The,novel,opens,on,a,dreary,November,afternoon,at,Gateshead,the,home,of,the,wealthy,Reed,family,
A,young,girl,named,Jane,Eyre,sits,in,the,drawing,room,reading,Bewick’s,History,of,British,Birds,
Jane’s,aunt,Mrs,Reed,has,forbidden,her,niece,to,play,with,her,cousins,Eliza,Georgiana,and,the,bullying,John,
John,chides,Jane,for,being,a,lowly,orphan,who,is,only,permitted,to,live,with,the,Reeds,because,of,his,mother’s,charity,
John,then,hurls,a,book,at,the,young,girl,pushing,her,to,the,end,of,her,patience,
Jane,finally,erupts,and,the,two,cousins,fight,
Mrs,Reed,holds,Jane,responsible,for,the,scuffle,and,sends,her,to,the,“red,room”—the,frightening,chamber,in,which,her,Uncle,Reed,died—as,punishment,

Two,servants,Miss,Abbott,and,Bessie,Lee,escort,Jane,to,the,red,room,and,Jane,resists,them,with,all,of,her,might,
Once,locked,in,the,room,Jane,catches,a,glimpse,of,her,ghastly,figure,in,the,mirror,and,shocked,by,her,meager,presence,she,begins,to,reflect,on,the,events,that,have,led,her,to,such,a,state,
She,remembers,her,kind,Uncle,Reed,bringing,her,to,Gateshead,after,her,parents’,death,and,she,recalls,his,dying,command,that,his,wife,promise,to,raise,Jane,as,one,of,her,own,
Suddenly,Jane,is,struck,with,the,impression,that,her,Uncle,Reed’s,ghost,is,in,the,room,and,she,imagines,that,he,has,come,to,take,revenge,on,his,wife,for,breaking,her,promise,
Jane,cries,out,in,terror,but,her,aunt,believes,that,she,is,just,trying,to,escape,her,punishment,and,she,ignores,her,pleas,
Jane,faints,in,exhaustion,and,fear,

When,she,wakes,Jane,finds,herself,in,her,own,bedroom,in,the,care,of,Mr,Lloyd,the,family’s,kind,apothecary,
Bessie,is,also,present,and,she,expresses,disapproval,of,her,mistress’s,treatment,of,Jane,
Jane,remains,in,bed,the,following,day,and,Bessie,sings,her,a,song,
Mr,Lloyd,speaks,with,Jane,about,her,life,at,Gateshead,and,he,suggests,to,Jane’s,aunt,that,the,girl,be,sent,away,to,school,where,she,might,find,happiness,
Jane,is,cautiously,excited,at,the,possibility,of,leaving,Gateshead,

Soon,after,her,own,reflections,on,the,past,in,the,red,room,Jane,learns,more,of,her,history,when,she,overhears,a,conversation,between,Bessie,and,Miss,Abbott,
Jane’s,mother,was,a,member,of,the,wealthy,Reed,family,which,strongly,disapproved,of,Jane’s,father,an,impoverished,clergyman,
When,they,married,Jane’s,wealthy,maternal,grandfather,wrote,his,daughter,out,of,his,will,
Not,long,after,Jane,was,born,Jane’s,parents,died,from,typhus,which,Jane’s,father,contracted,while,caring,for,the,poor,

“I,am,glad,you,are,no,relation,of,mine,
I,will,never,call,you,aunt,again,as,long,as,I,live,
I,will,never,come,to,visit,you,when,I,am,grown,up;,and,if,any,one,asks,me,how,I,liked,you,and,how,you,treated,me,I,will,say,the,very,thought,of,you,makes,me,sick,

Four,days,after,meeting,Mr,Brocklehurst,Jane,boards,the,6,AM,coach,and,travels,alone,to,Lowood,
When,she,arrives,at,the,school,the,day,is,dark,and,rainy,and,she,is,led,through,a,grim,building,that,will,be,her,new,home,
The,following,day,Jane,is,introduced,to,her,classmates,and,learns,the,daily,routine,which,keeps,the,girls,occupied,from,before,dawn,until,dinner,
Miss,Temple,the,superintendent,of,the,school,is,very,kind,while,one,of,Jane’s,teachers,Miss,Scatcherd,is,unpleasant,particularly,in,her,harsh,treatment,of,a,young,student,named,Helen,Burns,
Jane,and,Helen,befriend,one,another,and,Jane,learns,from,Helen,that,Lowood,is,a,charity,school,maintained,for,female,orphans,which,means,that,the,Reeds,have,paid,nothing,to,put,her,there,
She,also,learns,that,Mr,Brocklehurst,oversees,every,aspect,of,its,operation:,even,Miss,Temple,must,answer,to,him,

On,Jane’s,second,morning,at,Lowood,the,girls,are,unable,to,wash,as,the,water,in,their,pitchers,is,frozen,
Jane,quickly,learns,that,life,at,the,school,is,harsh,
The,girls,are,underfed,overworked,and,forced,to,sit,still,during,seemingly,endless,sermons,
Still,she,takes,comfort,in,her,new,friendship,with,Helen,who,impresses,Jane,with,her,expansive,knowledge,and,her,ability,to,patiently,endure,even,the,cruelest,treatment,from,Miss,Scatcherd,
Helen,tells,Jane,that,she,practices,a,doctrine,of,Christian,endurance,which,means,loving,her,enemies,and,accepting,her,privation,
Jane,disagrees,strongly,with,such,meek,tolerance,of,injustice,but,Helen,takes,no,heed,of,Jane’s,arguments,
Helen,is,self,critical,only,because,she,sometimes,fails,to,live,up,to,her,ascetic,standards:,she,believes,that,she,is,a,poor,student,and,chastises,herself,for,daydreaming,about,her,home,and,family,when,she,should,be,concentrating,on,her,studies,

For,most,of,Jane’s,first,month,at,Lowood,Mr,Brocklehurst,spends,his,time,away,from,the,school,
When,he,returns,Jane,becomes,quite,nervous,because,she,remembers,his,promise,to,her,aunt,Mrs,Reed,to,warn,the,school,about,Jane’s,supposed,habit,of,lying,
When,Jane,inadvertently,drops,her,slate,in,Mr,Brocklehurst’s,presence,he,is,furious,and,tells,her,she,is,careless,
He,orders,Jane,to,stand,on,a,stool,while,he,tells,the,school,that,she,is,a,liar,and,he,forbids,the,other,students,to,speak,to,her,for,the,rest,of,the,day,
Helen,makes,Jane’s,day,of,humiliation,endurable,by,providing,her,friend,with,silent,consolation—she,covertly,smiles,at,Jane,every,time,she,passes,by,

Finally,at,five,o’clock,the,students,disperse,and,Jane,collapses,to,the,floor,
Deeply,ashamed,she,is,certain,that,her,reputation,at,Lowood,has,been,ruined,but,Helen,assures,her,that,most,of,the,girls,felt,more,pity,for,Jane,than,revulsion,at,her,alleged,deceitfulness,
Jane,tells,Miss,Temple,that,she,is,not,a,liar,and,relates,the,story,of,her,tormented,childhood,at,Gateshead,
Miss,Temple,seems,to,believe,Jane,and,writes,to,Mr,Lloyd,requesting,confirmation,of,Jane’s,account,of,events,
Miss,Temple,offers,Jane,and,Helen,tea,and,seed,cake,endearing,herself,even,further,to,Jane,
When,Mr,Lloyd’s,letter,arrives,and,corroborates,Jane’s,story,Miss,Temple,publicly,declares,Jane,to,be,innocent,
Relieved,and,contented,Jane,devotes,herself,to,her,studies,
She,excels,at,drawing,and,makes,progress,in,French,

In,the,spring,life,at,Lowood,briefly,seems,happier,but,the,damp,forest,dell,in,which,the,school,resides,is,a,breeding,ground,for,typhus,and,in,the,warm,temperatures,more,than,half,the,girls,fall,ill,with,the,disease,
Jane,remains,healthy,and,spends,her,time,playing,outdoors,with,a,new,friend,Mary,Ann,Wilson,
Helen,is,sick,but,not,with,typhus—Jane,learns,the,horrific,news,that,her,friend,is,dying,of,consumption,
One,evening,Jane,sneaks,into,Miss,Temple’s,room,to,see,Helen,one,last,time,
Helen,promises,Jane,that,she,feels,little,pain,and,is,happy,to,be,leaving,the,world’s,suffering,behind,
Jane,takes,Helen,into,her,arms,and,the,girls,fall,asleep,
During,the,night,Helen,dies,
Her,grave,is,originally,unmarked,but,fifteen,years,after,her,death,a,gray,marble,tablet,is,placed,over,the,spot,(presumably,by,Jane),bearing,the,single,word,Resurgam,Latin,for,“I,shall,rise,again,

After,Mr,Brocklehurst’s,negligent,treatment,of,the,girls,at,Lowood,is,found,to,be,one,of,the,causes,of,the,typhus,epidemic,a,new,group,of,overseers,is,brought,in,to,run,the,school,
Conditions,improve,dramatically,for,the,young,girls,and,Jane,excels,in,her,studies,for,the,next,six,years,
After,spending,two,more,years,at,Lowood,as,a,teacher,Jane,decides,she,is,ready,for,a,change,partly,because,Miss,Temple,gets,married,and,leaves,the,school,
She,advertises,in,search,of,a,post,as,a,governess,and,accepts,a,position,at,a,manor,called,Thornfield,
